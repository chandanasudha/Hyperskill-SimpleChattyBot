## Stages
**Stage 1: Chatty Bot welcomes you**   
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.

**Stage 2: Print your name**   
Introduce yourself to the bot.

**Stage 3: Guess the age**   
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.

**Stage 4: Learning numbers**   
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!

**Stage 5: Multiple choice**  
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
